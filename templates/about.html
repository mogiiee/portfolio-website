                   Hello everyone. My name is Amogh Arya, and you're all going be occupied for the next 4 minutes listening to or reading my SWOT analysis. <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   Swot stands for:  <br>
                   
                   S-STRENGTHS <br>
                   
                   W- WEAKNESSESS <br>
                   
                   O- OPPOTUNITIES <br>
                   
                   T-THREATS <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   I'll describe myself in the same order. <br>
                   
                    
                   
                    
                   
                  <h3>STRENGTHS:</h3> STRENGTHS: <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   I was fortunate enough to be born in a family that always supported me in almost everything I wanted to do. <br>
                   
                   Be it drumming, gaming, swimming, acting, DJ-ing or even studying (although I was not engrossed in it at first, it came along later). Therefore, I became good at all these activities.
                   
                    
                   
                   I am a very happy and fun person in general, and that’s where one of my strengths lies. I am a people-person, so I can mingle with almost everyone present around me.
                   
                    
                   
                   I always look for the best opportunities around myself that interest me and I use them to the fullest extent possible.
                   
                    
                   
                   I know quite a few languages which us humans understand and I threw in one just for the sake of our fellow computers. To be precise, I know English, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, French and Python. I also have an international degree from France which states that I know the basics of French. Call it a brag but I am proud of how I pulled that off. <br>
                   
                    
                   
                  <b>To round it all up my strengths are:</b>  <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   1.Public speaking <br>
                   
                   2.Determination <br>
                   
                   3.Good at making first impressions <br>
                   
                   4.Ever learning <br>
                   
                    
                   
                    
                   
                  <h3>WEAKNESSES:</h3> 
                   
                    
                   
                   Now comes the gloomy part “weaknesses”. Everyone has them, but the people who try to convert their weaknesses into their strong or middling points are the ones who flourish, and I thrive every day to do so. <br>                 
                    
                   
                   As I mingle with a lot of people, I seldom say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which might offend a person, or worse, infuriate them. This is something which I work on every day, to make myself better. So, if we ever meet in the future and I say something I am not supposed to, please don’t be offended. <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   Another weakness of mine is that I sometimes make decisions in an impulsive or hasty manner and this results in poor quality of work.
                   
                    
                   
                   <b>To sum it all up my weaknesses are:</b> <br>

                   
                    
                   
                   1.              Choice of words is not always correct <br>
                   
                   2.              I sometimes make faulty decisions <br>
                   
                    
                   
                    
                   
                   <h3>OPPORTUNITIES:</h3>
                   
                    
                   
                   If I had an endless ocean of opportunities then first: <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   1.              I would work on my weaknesses.<br>
                   
                   2.             I would learn new computer languages.<br>
                   
                   3.             I would learn to fly an airplane.<br>
                   
                   4.             I would make more friends.<br>
                   
                   5.             I would learn to play tennis. (You will understand why in a few seconds)<br>
                   
                   6.             I would want to join a band as the drummer.<br>
                   
                    
                   
                    
                   
                   <h3>THREATS:</h3>
                   
                    
                   
                   A 'threat' is a different kind of feeling for everyone; some are scared of spiders and global warming while some are scared of the present president of the USA. Agreed; creepy crawlies and not so great men are scary, but what I find a threat remains something very different. <br>
                   
                    
                   
                   I am scared that the world is ever changing. Let me explain.<br>
                   
                    
                   
                   My cousin sister is about seven years younger to me and is already learning different computer languages and the basics of integral calculus, she can play tennis way better than a lot of people I know (now you know why I want to learn tennis). When she was 5 she could download an app from the play store and login to her email ID to check her so called 'e-mails'. <br> When I was her age I used to wonder when the next Krrish movie would come out so that I can go out and have ice cream.
                   
                    
                   
                   What I'm trying to say is that us humans are heading to a future where no amount of constant knowledge is enough. If you excel at something today, there will be a thousand other people who are better than you at it tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow the same thing might even become outdated. So many new things come into existence every day and a person has to become a machine to keep track of the things which are going on around him.
                   
                    
                   
                   <br><br>My grandpa says that a lot has changed from when he was young. I am scared of the day that I become a grandpa and find out that the life which I have lived has become  outdated.
                   
                    
                   
                    
                   
                   Thank you for your valuable time.
